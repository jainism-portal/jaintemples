## History
Thane city is chiefly related to King Shripal (the meditator on Navapada). Since this is a historical city, it is believed that there were many temples in it. Happiness or unhappiness of man is caused by his karma, Mayanasundari, the daughter of King Prajacal of Ujjain firmly believed this. She had great faith in Navapada and propitiated it. She was married to King Shripal who was suffering from leucoderma. By virtue of propotiation of the Navapada, they pacified the disease and attained prosperity. he attained many achievements, went to the Champa city and established his rule. The rasa (circular dance accompanies by singing) of King Shripal and Mayanasundari (the rasa of propitiating Navapadaji) is famous even today. The idol was installed in this temple on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Magh in the year 2005 of the vikram era. This temple is also called the Konkan Shetrunjaya Navapada temple.
